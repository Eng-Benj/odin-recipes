# odin-recipes
The first full assignment from The Odin Project Foundations Course

This project aims to create a basic website using knowledge gained through the "HTML Foundations" set of lessons. The website will consist of an index page containing links to recipe-specific pages. In turn, these recipe pages will each outline a step-by-step guide to making the associated recipe, including a list of ingredients and a picture of the final dish.

This project showcases my understanding and application of the fundamentals of HTML, including...
 - Boilerplate generation and use
 - The application of descending headers (<h0>)
 - The use of relative and absolute links (<a href="">)
 - The insertion of images (<img src="" alt="">)
 - The appropriate choice of unsorted (<ul>) and sorted (<ol>) lists (<li>)
 - The separation of text using paragraphs (<p>)
