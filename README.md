# odin-recipes
The first full assignment from The Odin Project Foundations Course

This project aims to create a basic website using knowledge gained through the "HTML Foundations" set of lessons. The website will consist of an index page containing links to recipe-specific pages. In turn, these recipe pages will each outline a step-by-step guide to making the associated recipe, including a list of ingredients and a picture of the final dish.
